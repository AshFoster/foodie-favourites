### Performance Testing

I audited the website for mobile and desktop using Google Chrome's lighthouse feature. All scores were high. It might only be examing the landing page and not the in-game page.

The final lighthouse scores are as follows:

### Device and Browser Compatibility Testing

To test the site's compatibility across a range of devices I used [Responsinator](https://www.responsinator.com/) and went through all of the user and owner goals on each device it includes in both portrait and landscape modes. The devices included are as follows:

  - iPhone X
  - Pixel 2
  - iPhone 6-8
  - iPhone 6-8 Large Version
  - iPad

Chrome Dev Tools was also used to check the site's compatibility across a range of other devices also in both portrait and landscape modes. These devices include:

  - Ipad Pro
  - Galaxy Fold (which has a very narrow viewport of only 280px in portrait mode)

Actual mobile devices belonging to family and friends were also used for testing which includes the following:

  - iPhone 7
  - Pixel 4
  - S10 Plus

A desktop monitor was also used for testing with a couple of different resolutions to check that the site remains to look and act as expected on larger screens. The resolutions were: 1366 x 768 and 1920 x 1080.

Google Chrome was the browser used for the majority of testing during the development process, but once development had neared an end some other browsers were used for testing to make sure the site had cross-browser compatibility. The full list of browsers used for testing are as follows:

  - Chrome
  - Internet Explorer 11
  - Edge
  - Firefox
